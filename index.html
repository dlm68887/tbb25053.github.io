<p style="color:White;text-align:center;font-size:14pt;">For this project I thought I would share something that took me a little over a year to develop. I am the co-owner of an online boutique called Brunch Babe. My sister Nicole is the other owner, and this online boutique has been a dream of ours for years. This past May, our site finally launched! Since our online boutique has launched we have really enjoyed being fully involved in the marketing and distribution of clothing.</p>

  <h2>Formation of Shop Brunch Babe</h2>
  <p>Growing up with my sisters Nicole (23) and Macy(17), we were always sharing clothes. Nicole and I are only 2 years apart in age so we tended to share clothes more frequently than Macy and I. Through all of the childhood disputes on whose shirt was whose and miscommunication on borrowing things, fashion was still something that the three of us all bonded over. Nicole attended college in Atlanta so she could get a Bachelor’s Degree while performing as a Falcons Cheerleader, and I decided to go to UGA to enjoy the perks of a big school and SEC Saturday’s. Since Macy, is younger than Nicole and me, it was difficult for her to be hands on with the upstart of our online boutique, but Macy still contributes by picking out items and marketing them on social media. Even with the distance and the age difference, Shop Brunch Babe has been something to continuously bring us together.

 <p>It has been really great watching our boutique slowly get more traction and online visits. My sisters and I have faith in our boutique’s continual growth.<q>To everything, there is a season, a time for every purpose over Heaven.</q> Ecc 3:1</p>

<p style="color:White;text-align:center;font-size:18pt;"> As a young female entrepreneur, I think it is very important to promote other women in the work force. The Video that I have attached really instilled in ,e the importance that success truly exhibits as a female. This video demonstrates the importance to persevere through adversity in society.  </p>
